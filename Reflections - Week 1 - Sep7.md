### Reflections & Actions
* I need to learn more about version control to bolster my subject knowledge.
    * 13/09/20 - Starting to learn about this by creating a Github repository for all of my reflections to be collated throughout the course.
* Best computing practice needs to be used across the course, it is expected of us within the computing cohort.
* I need to experiment with some screen capture softwares so that I can find what is best for my workflow and needs.

### Future Points
* In the long term I need to gain more confidence with recording myself and having a virtual presence as I have little experience of communicating in this way.
