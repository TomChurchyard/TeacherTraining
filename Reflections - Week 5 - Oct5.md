R4P - How do children learn?

### Reflections

* Reading more in depth about the Rosenshine approach has led me to realise how much of it I recognise from my time at schoola few years ago.
    * This approach is used at the school at which my partner works; being able to discuss aspects of this with her has been eye opening and very useful.

* Once again it has been beneficial to observe a recorded classroom lesson, I have tried to take notes not only on the lesson content and teaching methods but also behaviour management policies when they have been used.
    * I have been invited to go to my partners school and observe some lessons for a day next week. I hope that this will give me further insight and allow me to observe a wide range of teaching styles.

Subject Pedagogy 6 - Behaviour

### Reflections
* Learning and discussing the fundamentals of behaviour management has been insightful and useful to my overall understanding of classroom management.
    * Learning that lesson content can be as much of a cause of bad behaviour as external factors has made me consider how engaging certain lessosn are and how they can be made more accessible.
        * Behaviour management being almost entirely proactive is not something I had considered in depth before, the reactive methods are only the tip of the iceberg.

* Positive re-enforcement and methods of providing it must be consistent, without the consistency the enforcement will be weak and may not have an effect.
    * The same is true for negative inforcement, it's all about having a stable routine for each situation.
        * I had not considered quite how important these things are until this session, it makes complete sense that there is such an emphasis on methods of behaviour management but at the same time was not something that I had explored before.

* Being able to discuss certain aspects of the session in small groups at the end is a very useful way for me to make sure that there are no gaps in my knowledge and understanding of the afternoon's content.
