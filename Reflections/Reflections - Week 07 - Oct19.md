A day observing lessons in school.

* Thanks to some of my partners contacts I was able to spend a day observing at the Norton Knatchbull school in Ashford which is an all boys grammar school.
    * I initially found a few things about this school strange, mainly because my childhood was spent outside of Kent and so I have had no experience with grammar or single sex schools.
        * The standout difference between my time here and at Wye School last week is the emphasis on behaviour management. After spending a day in the school observing lessons there did not appear to be any obvious schoolwide behaviour systems in place.

* Lessons were not structured in quite the same way as they were at Wye School either with much more emphasis based on quiet work and a slightly less interactive form of teaching.
    * Whilst the schools both seem very different on the surface I am unsure as to how much these changes have an effect on the students. It would appear though that teaching styles are much more "tried and tested" and within the grammar environment.

R4P - How do children learn?

### Reflections
* There was a lot of emphasis on behaviour management and advice on how to settle and control a class. This builds on the content from last week and allows us to see some of the principals in practice.

* It was also enlightening to read some of the curriculum intent statements from some of the local partnered schools to understand the differences between them and which particular subject areas and beliefs that each school have.
    * Interestingly one of the schools in the list is the same school at which my partner teaches. Discussing this with her was very beneficial and eye opening.

Subject Pedagogy 8 - Questioning, Metacognition and PRIMM

### Reflections
* Learning more about diagnostic questions and their potential within a classroom was very useful, being able to collaboratively create some of our own and then critique each others questions was also incredibly beneficial.
    * The discussion of each others diagnostic questions was particularly helpful when reviewing my own work as it allowed me to see potential mistakes as well as methods that I myself had not considered.

* Again I really enjoyed the ability to split into 2 groups during a research task, in my case centering around the PRIMM method. Going back and teaching this to the other group when we all convened helped to cement the content that we had learned.
    * Being able to discuss topics within the group is very beneficial, especially during these times where we are unable to socially interact in the same ways as before.
