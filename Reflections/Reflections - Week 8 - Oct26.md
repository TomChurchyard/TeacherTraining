Reading Week

### Reflections
* During the week I have spent most of my working time tying up loose ends as well as researching some topics for my subject pedagogy assignment.
    * I believe that the topic that I shall be focusing on is Group Work with an emphasis on paired programming. Group work is something that I am passionate about within computer science, especially with the strong belief that some have of computing and programming being a solitary task or endeavor when this is not the case.
