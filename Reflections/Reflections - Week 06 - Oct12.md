R4P - How do children learn?

### Reflections
* The emphassis on behaviour and behaviour policy is helpful for those of us who had not given this element of teaching much thought before the subject pedagogy session on Friday with some of the materials being repeated.
    * Reading through these documents and comparing methods and policies has shown me the importance of having a strong policy in place but also making sure that it is equally balanced with positive reinforcement and praise where possible as well.
        * More than anything consistency seems to be the key when it comes to most of these policies, they only truly work when they are used all of the time. If the system is not fair to all students then the policy will be less effective, it is important that everyone understands the policy, both staff and students.

A day observing lessons in school.

### Reflections
* I understand that I am in a somewhat privileged position being able to visit my partner's school and observe lessons for the day and I really do appreciate the oppertunity. I understand why placements are later than usual this year and that things have not been easy for anyone to organise activities during this time.
    * Being able to visit a school to observe lessons is incredibly beneficial when it comes to applying the theory that we have been learning. A few things that I didn't immediately understand clicked when I saw the same methods and theories in practice within the school.

* Whilst observing one of the lessons at the school I quickly noticed that a lot of Rosenshine's principals were being used.
    * Most prominently were the principals of reviewing knowledge, at the beginning of class the teacher reviewed the previous lessons content with this content being repeated until all of the students understood. As each task took place the teacher would assess the group as a whole looking for any students who may be struggling with work being repeated until everyone had cemented the task.
        * Towards the end of the lesson scaffolding for more difficult tasks became apparent with some students using notes in their book to help them complete the task which, after a few rounds of repetition, were then closed to fully test the knowledge aquired during the lesson.

Subject Pedagogy 7 - Microteaching & Paired Programming

### Reflections
* Teaching my 20 minute lesson was incredibly helpful/daunting but also allowed me to see where my strengths and weaknesses are. 
    * The peer and professional feedback after the lesson was particularly helpful in providing me with points to focus on in the future. Some of the main points being making sure that I have cemented the context and information before proceeding with a task, and providing more structure to the end of the lesson to wrap things up and check understanding.
        * For a first attempt at teaching I believe the session went well and has provided me with more confidence for the next time, whether that be in an online space with my peers or in a classroom with students.

* Completing the paired programming task with Eshwar was very useful as it allowed me to see the importance of us both discussing the descisions that we were making as well as how useful it can be as a tool to fill gaps in our knowledge.
    * Whilst the code that we were writing was not overly complex it was very interesting to explore differences between syntax within a social scenario instead of it being a completely solo venture.
        * Paired programming could also help us to convey that programming is not a anti-social activity and in fact is something that requires a great deal of collaboration and communication in order to create asomething of value.

* Again it is always helpful to run through teaching resources and practices that will be helpful to us when we start planning and teaching in schools.
    * Some of the collaborative systems in place such as Google Docs and Office 365 were already familiar to me but other systems such as whiteboard.fi and repl.it were things I had never experienced before.
        * I think these collaborative systems will be incredibly useful for increasing engagement but also allowing students to help each other and push themselves in the case of systems such as repl.it.
