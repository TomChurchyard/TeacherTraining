Inclusion Week

### Reflections

* Whilst I have a small amount of experience with children that are SEN, I did not have any experience with children that required this level of assistance or specialised learning.
	* There are stark differences between how SEN schools are operated and the learning techniques used to assist them that I had not even considered.
		* The knowledge and expertise that the staff possess within each of the schools that I heard from was outstanding, there appears to be a definite drive to improve skills, deepen knowledge, and overall be able to reflect on themselves and improve.

* The amount of live content was really refreshing, a large amount of the previous weeks content has been asynchronous so being able to interact with someone surrouding the topics was hugely beneficial.
