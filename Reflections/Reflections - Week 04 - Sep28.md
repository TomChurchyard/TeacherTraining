R4P - How do children learn?

First whole week of Replacement for Placement material.

### Reflections
* Although watching the Teachers TV lesson videos are not the same as being in the classroom at this stage of the course it is still useful to have this insight.
    * Watching the lesson and making notes allowed me to get a better idea of teaching methods as well as things to avoid or do differently myself.
        

* The information concerning cognitive load theory was eyeopening and suprising.
    * Working memory being so short/small and long term memory being unlimited establishes the importance of repetition and rehearsal within teaching and learning.
        * This information will be incredibly useful when planning future lessons as for information retention to be effective rehearsal is needed. This idea meshes neatly with some of Rosenshine's principals.

Subject Pedagogy 5 - How do children learn?

### Reflections

* The 3 hour session was very interesting and I feel that we covered a lot of material within a short space of time.
    * Breakout groups with anther person to discuss the ideas and principals with helped with my understanding of the topic as well as in some cases provided me with an alternative viewpoint.
        * Discussions between the PGCE and Schools Direct cohorts were very insightful as our workloads during the week are incredibly different. At the moment this is one of the most effective ways for us to understand how these principals are used within schools today.

* Covering a broad selection of topics is helpful as it allows the comparison between different methods and viewpoints.
    * Some of the topics would be nice to discuss in further detail, potentially with the option to discuss these things within breakout pairs.
