R4P - What does inclusion really mean?

### Reflections
* Learning more about questioning and how we as teachers can encourage further interaction and engagement within the classroom was interesting.
    * The idea of asking students directly for answers instead of asking for "hands up" was soemthing that I had not considered within until now.
        * Bouncing from one student to another to gain a deeper insight as well as to elaborate further on the answer seems to be a very effective way of increasing engagement.

* Learning about the different methods of inclusion is a helpful insight prior to our SEND Week in a few days time. Gaining familiarity with some of the phrases and jobs surrounding it should help when it comes to next weeks content.

Subject Pedagogy 9 - Inclusion, Differentiation, and SEN

### Reflections
* Discussion surrounding our beliefs and views of single sex, grammar, and special needs schools was enlightening and in some cases suprising.
    * We all had slightly different views when it came to grammar schools and single sex schools, with all of us being able to express some positive and negative aspects of each. My immediate view surrounding special needs schools was that they are beneficial and necessary places within our current education system. This however was challenged during the discussion as it may be more beneficial for these students to be mixed at another school potentially with additional help instead of a separate school altogether. 
        * As usual I find the group discussions that we have as a cohort to be very helpful in understanding both my own knowledge and viewpoints but also as a method to fill in some of the gaps in my knowledge and gain a better understanding of how other people may think about certain aspects of education.

* Learning about the CAT testing system and the content of these tests was again something that I was not completely aware of prior to this session.
    * I appreciate that these tests are designed to gain a better understanding of intelligence rather than knowledge which I believe is a very beneficial metric for us a teachers to be aware of. However I can understand the consideration that students can be under a lot of pressure and that it could be said that they are already tested enough.
