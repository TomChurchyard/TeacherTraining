Reflections - Week 3 - September 21 - 27
===
I will be using Rolfe et al.'s model of reflection when making my reflection notes this week in order to try and bring a bit more structure to my writing.

### Notes
* We discussed various views surrounding the teaching occupation in small groups and tried to reflect on personal or other bias that may make us feel positively or negatively in relation to each statement.

### Reflections
* There are many views that appear to be polarising within the field with very well thought out arguments for each side. 
    * Critiquing and challenging these views is important but it is also important to respect the opinion of others. 
        * Exploring different ideas surrounding the profession is important in order to develop and improve things.

First REE Session - Welcoming Schools
### Reflections
* How do children understand what it means to be welcoming? What features make schools welcoming/unwelcoming?
    * Discussing these very broad questions with others revealed many ideas of not only hwat it means to be welcoming but how we subconciously do or say things that can be percieved as welcoming or unwelcoming.
        * Narrowing down some of these ideas and exploring them further should give me a better idea of exactly what it is that I would like to write about for my assignment.
* Overall discussions about inclusivity surrounding many topics were also helpful when considering what it means to be welcome.

REE Session - Welcoming Schools
### Reflections
* Prof Bob Bowie spoke about some very insightful topics surrounding the ideas of being welcome. One of the main things that stood out to me was the idea of learning a language so that you can communicate to people as a tourist.
    * For me this idea brought on further thought about how although we may feel like we are being welcoming by learning a language when visiting a foreign country, we are only doing so to further ourselves and not to welcome those same people who may be visiting us.
        * I would like to further explore scenarios where this same theme applies, when doing a percievably welcoming action may not be for the most welcoming of reasons.
* "We should welcome people who are not like us."
* Who needs welcome in schools?

First Replacement for Placement Session
### Reflections
* On a personal level I am struggling slightly with the amount of video based content during the course, (I fully understand that this is nobody's fault and that everyone is doing the best that they can) and the daily activities being majority was not immediately engaging.
    * Having said this the content that I did watch was helpful and engaging and the assignment being released this early on was nice to see. It would be nice for the assignment to be properly indroduced during a collaborate session in the coming days if possible.
        * Overall I need to find a way of more effectively working from home now that the course is 100% remote until after Christmas. I will try and explore ways to make working remotely more engaging for me over the next few days.

Subject Pedagogy 4 - What is Education?
### Reflections
* Hearing the personal experience from some of my peers who are on the Schools Direct program was very insightful and useful to those of us who are not yet in schools.
    * The advice given will hopefully allow us a slightly smoother transition into schools when that happens later in the year. Although I fully understand that there is no replacement for being in the school observing lessons and teaching the students it is incredibly valuable for us to have this second hand insight.
        * Exploring ideas surrounding teaching with the students on the School Direct course is invaluable and we should make the most of their experiences during these times.

* Reviewing the differing schemes of work that I found online when compared to the national curriculum was interesting.
    * The national curriculum is fairly open and gives a very general overview of what is expected to be taught. Whilst the national curriculum doesn't tend to include any ICT specific content most of the schemes of work do.
        * Without the basic knowledge of using a computer which was previously taught within ICT/IT curriculums it is important that we include these skills within the digital literacy component of the computing curriculum. Without these perceivably more basic skills I feel that it would be much harder to teach some of the more in depth elements of the computing curriculum effectively.
