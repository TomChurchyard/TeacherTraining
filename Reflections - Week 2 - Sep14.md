### Reflections & Actions
* Learned the varying definitions of professionalism and the differences between them. We also discussed examples of unprofessional teaching and ways of avoiding these situations.
* Discussed our support network with an emphasis on the role of the mentor.
    * Who is a mentor?
    * How could they support you?
    * Mentor standards.
* How to be a good mentee e.g. the 4 'R's.
* Contracting - the relationship with your mentor.
    * Expectations, practicalities, and boundaries.

### Future Points
* Read over the questions to ask my future mentor in the coming weeks to see if I think they are still valid or if there is anything else that would be of value to ask.

### Reflections & Actions
* Discussed and clarified the difference between Computing and Computer Science.
    * Computer science being a subset of computing.
* Expectations from both society, students, and ourselves concerning teaching computing.
    * Students may think that they will be the next big game developer by the end of the course.
    * We need to expect that student's initial skillsets may be lower than we would desire.
    * Society may have the view that we are creating robotic workers, creating the next Silicon Valley executives, or teaching things that they may not feel are as 'useful' as other subjects.
* Discussed cognitive bias, both bias that we and others may have.
    * Sunk cost fallacy.
    * Halo effect.
    * Optimism bias.
* Pedagogy - How do we teach? Definitions and methods.
* Discussion surrounding various different computing resources for the classroom.
    * Research these and more concerning the assignment.
* Ofsted inspection criteria discussed, this is one way of how we will be monitored when working in schools.
* How to use library search and reserve a timeslot to browse the library, probably our best source of up to date journals and other research texts for the assignment.
* Subject Pedagogy Assignment - discussion surrounding it, 2000 word essay + 2000 word equivalent poster. (To be confirmed although is unlikely to change significantly).

### Future Points
