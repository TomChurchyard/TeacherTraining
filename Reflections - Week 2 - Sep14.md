### Reflections & Actions
* Learned the varying definitions of professionalism and the differences between them. We also discussed examples of unprofessional teaching and ways of avoiding these situations.
* Discussed our support network with an emphasis on the role of the mentor.
    * Who is a mentor?
    * How could they support you?
    * Mentor standards.
* How to be a good mentee e.g. the 4 'R's.
* Contracting - the relationship with your mentor.
    * Expectations, practicalities, and boundaries.

### Future Points
* Read over the questions to ask my future mentor in the coming weeks to see if I think they are still valid or if there is anything else that would be of value to ask.

### Reflections & Actions
* Discussed and clarified the difference between Computing and Computer Science.
    * Computer science being a subset of computing.
* Expectations from both society, students, and ourselves concerning teaching computing.
    * Students may think that they will be the next big game developer by the end of the course.
    * We need to expect that student's initial skillsets may be lower than we would desire.
    * Society may have the view that we are creating robotic workers, creating the next Silicon Valley executives, or teaching things that they may not feel are as 'useful' as other subjects.
* Discussed cognitive bias, both bias that we and others may have.
    * Sunk cost fallacy.
    * Halo effect.
    * Optimism bias.
* Pedagogy - How do we teach? Definitions and methods.
* Discussion surrounding various different computing resources for the classroom.
    * Research these and more concerning the assignment.
* Ofsted inspection criteria discussed, this is one way of how we will be monitored when working in schools.
* How to use library search and reserve a timeslot to browse the library, probably our best source of up to date journals and other research texts for the assignment.
* Subject Pedagogy Assignment - discussion surrounding it, 2000 word essay + 2000 word equivalent poster. (To be confirmed although is unlikely to change significantly).

How to: Reflections
* Rolfe et al.'s reflective model
    * What?
    * So what?
    * Now what?

### Reflections
* Safeguarding is the responsibility of everyone
    * Make sure everything is recorded if a situation does need to be reported
* Rolfe et al.'s reflective model is much more in depth than what I have been doing up to this point.
    * I will experiment with using this method to record reflections from now on in the hope that my reflections will be more detailed and informative.

### Reflections
* Always remember why you want to become a teacher.
* I need to put an emphasis on my wellbeing during the year.
    * Things like making time for friends, participating in a hobby, and spending more time for events with my family where I can.
* A large number of teachers start out very idealistic.
    * It is then important to resolve the differences between what you want things to be like within your classroom/school/personal life and what is actually happening around and to you.

### Reflections
* The Kent selective system is odd for me considering I am someone who went to school outside of the county.
    * I need to learn more about the content of the Kent/Shepway tests and how the selective system works. I am unsure as to how I feel about the system in general although this could be due to me having not experienced it personally.
* What education performs and why we educate.
    * Qualification, socialisation, subjectification. Explore these further along with ideas of what schools are for.
